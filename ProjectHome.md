## Project Closed ##
> As most features of this app now are available on the stock iphone OS3+, and I have not been able to touch iPhone development for a long long time, so I decide to STOP this project.

> Thank you all guys, especially to whom donated me, sorry to let you down.

> I'm not leaving, but just stay somewhere watching the crazy apple world. And hope to meet you again one day.

> I don't know :)

> Good bye!


## !!!NEED YOUR HELP!!! - About iSMS for iPhone 2.x firmware ##
> Thank you all guys who donated or sent me emails for the new iSMS 2.0 porting work.

> I have started the 2.x porting work with [Holly](http://www.freecoder.org)'s help.

> Actually I have a lot of ideas to make iSMS perfect, but unfortunately, because I have a very busy job in daylight and lacking of development environment(Only my home old PC desktop has OSX installed, my D630 laptop sucks with OSX), so please don't expect too much on the progress :)

> Here I'd like to ask you to help me for:
    * Tips on how to install OSX on Dell D630 laptop. If you have that knowledge and had success story, please drop me email.
    * Tips on how to compile 2.0 toolchain under Linux(I'm using ubuntu804 and tried lot's of tuturials for that but finally failed.)
    * OR Donate me more for a new Mac Book Pro if you have no idea about the above.

> BTW, it's hardly possible for iSMS to be listed in the AppStore because:
    * It uses lot's of undocumented APIs that are disallowd by Apple
    * It might hookup into Springboard for SMS filtering
    * The author is not a Mac user :_|_

Thanks,

Shawn/2008-09-10

## Old but still important ##
  * NOTE: - **You're highly recommended to remove the old version of iSMS completely(uninstall, and reboot your phone by holding the power key) before installing the new RC2 snapshot version.**
  * Supports 1.1.3 (even 1.1.4 I think, not tested though)
  * The first TRUE native SMS app! iSMS is now fully using Apple Native API to send and receive SMS, so NO more SMS sending problems!

# iSMS 1.0 RC1 source code is NOW available ! #
- **03/24/2008** - A kind remind. iSMS source code is released under GPLv2, if you used any of my code in your own cute app, please release your source as well and keep my credit in your apps, thanks.

- 03/03/2008 - Wanna to know how iSMS hook up the SMS notification and take over apple's default SMS applicatio ? Check out the latest source code in the download section for all the secrets!(BTW, please forgive me for the ugly code, it's just a PoC to me for SMS hacking).

~~No one [donated](http://shawn.chain.googlepages.com/) money to me yet~~(Thank you Anthony, you're the first one who [donated!](http://shawn.chain.googlepages.com/)), so I don't know how many people will donate their money or effort on improving this application, let's pray and see. But I think at least it could benefit those guys who want to know the secret of UIKit programming. In deed there're no secrets but just put your time into it and that's all. To me it killed most of my sparetime since 2007/10(BTW, I have no idea about Apple before :).

Good luck and have fun geeks!

# iSMS-1.0-RC1 NEW features #
Well, these days I'm busying reverse engineering something... and here comes the result.
  * A new helper module is introduced and with the helper module, iSMS now can take over the default apple SMS application! (Currently only support 1.0.2/1.1.1)
  * Now will use the system UI components to display the recipients. More apple-ish!
  * Save to draft
  * Template customization
  * Simple but True SMS BlackList, yes it's true! No pop up, no daemon! and message will be deleted silently.
  * Will remove the 1000 message capacity limit.
